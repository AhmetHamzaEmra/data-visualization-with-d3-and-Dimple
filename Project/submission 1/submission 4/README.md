## Feedbacks
### Dr. Kemal Aydin (North American University-Prof)

This is a nice visual representation of the financial data. Looks promising.
Right now it seems that the data is hard coded. x.addOrderRule (...)
If you can change that and read data from the file that would be great.
Keep up good work!

### Talgat Yegizbayev (ACM ICPC lab Member )
The visualization is nice but it would be better if when the click on the circles,
it shoud shows the name of the county.

### Behic Guven (Design Club Leader )
I think the respresentation is okay but generally the page is little bit
new design objects. I recoment to add CSS for html.

## Design
I have chosen map chart as I present country statistic so it is comfortable to review on map with the tooltips I am trying the show viewer to explore by himself or herself. 

## Findings
In this visualization, as we can see there are more death in Middle East and Centeral Asia than America or Auropa. All losts are unfortinute but humanity need more improvement on those areas more. To make it more noticiable, tooltips can be used.
