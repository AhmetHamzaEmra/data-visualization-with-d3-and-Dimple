## Feedbacks
### Dr. Kemal Aydin (North American University-Prof)
#### For visualization 3:
This is a nice visual representation of the financial data. Looks promising.
Right now it seems that the data is hard coded. x.addOrderRule (...)
If you can change that and read data from the file that would be great.
Keep up good work!
